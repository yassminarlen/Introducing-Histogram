# Introducing-Histogram
1.Simple steps to creating a histogram using community data. A histogram is a graph used to demostrate the density of a single variable.

2.Keep in mind thay not all variables could be displayed as historgrams, we will use the "Show Me" feature located in the upper left corner of the screen.

3. Start by searching *broadband access* on the search bar highlighted in the upper right hand corner. **Broadband Access (Broadband Access is the percentage of households with a broadband internet connection through a subscription) is a variable included in the *2022 County Health Rankings* and also could be displayed as a histogram.** 
Drag and drop the second highlighted variable to the Colums row. On the "Show Me" feature select the highlighted histogram as the display option.

4. To edit the **BIN WIDTH** (width of each bar) of the histogram search for "Broadband access (bin)" it should be located at the left hand side as the first data point but if not, the highlighted  search tool will come in handy by searching for "bin".

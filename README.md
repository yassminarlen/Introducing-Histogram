# Introducing-Histogram

**What is a histogram?**
A histogram is a graph used to demostrate the density of a single variable.

**Introducing Broadband Acess**
 Broadband Access (Broadband Access is the percentage of households with a broadband internet connection through a subscription) is a variable included in the *2022 County Health Rankings* and also could be displayed as a histogram.

1.Keep in mind thay not all variables could be displayed as historgrams, we will use the "Show Me" feature located in the upper left corner of the screen.
![Show Me](https://github.com/yassminarlen/Introducing-Histogram/blob/main/Show%20me%20Feature.png?raw=true)  

2. Start by searching *broadband access* on the search bar highlighted in the upper right hand corner. 
Drag and drop the second highlighted variable to the Colums row. On the "Show Me" feature select the highlighted histogram as the display option.

3. To edit the **BIN WIDTH** (width of each bar) of the histogram search for "Broadband access (bin)" it should be located at the left hand side as the first data point but if not, the highlighted  search tool will come in handy by searching for "bin".

4. Click the drop down option. Next select "Edit...", when the pop-up appears change the number in the highlighted box to modify the bin width. keep in mind that change the width of the bins changes the amount max value of data/min value of data.

5. Start by taking notice of the blue highlighted x-axis, left click it for the pop-up menu to appear, then click the higlighted option "Edit Axis...".

Once you click it, a pop-up menu will appear click on the highlighted option "Tick Marks", then select the "Fixed" option for both fields , *Major Tick Marks* will modify the numbers displayed on the x-axis and *Minor Tick Marks* will modify the numbers displayed on the y-axis.

## More on Broadband Access
 In 2020, the bipartisan Broadband DATA act was passed by the federal government to improve broadband access and speeds by 2025. Yet, an estimated 19 million Americans lack access to reliable broadband internet. On average, half of US counties experience speeds below the federally defined broadband standard (25 Mbps down/3 Mbps up).[ However, broadband access is not an issue exclusive to rural areas (Broadband Access*, n.d.).
 
 -Broadband access is required to efficiently support employment opportunities, workforce development, education, health care (telehealth), and access to/enrollment in state and federal programs (e.g. SNAP). Broadband access can foster social connectedness, particularly among older populations, reducing the burden of social isolation, strengthening community support, and decreasing loneliness (Broadband Access*, n.d.).
 
 -Barriers to broadband access could be due to insufficient infrastructure, cost, or personal interest (e.g. older adults are less likely to purchase home internet), and this metric is unable to untangle 
these specific barriers (Broadband Access*, n.d.).
